    description 
		"<p>Without a 'Box' like type there will not be any direct support in the language for storing objects in Records and Tuples.</p>
		Instead using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbols-as-weakmap-keys\\\">symbols-as-weakmap-keys</a>,
		symbols in Record and Tuples could still refer to objects/functions via a WeakMap.
		Code will need to ensure the necessary code has access to these WeakMap side tables.
		APIs conventions will need to be established to distinguish when symbols are being used in this way.
		Care will need to be taken with the WeakMaps, if a Map is used by accident there is a risk of memory leaks.
		Unless direct access to the WeakMap is hidden behind a wrapper, other code could remove/replace the referenced
		object.

			Box use-cases include:
			<ul>

issue storingPrimitiveInBox {
	summary
		"storing <i>primitives*</i> in a Box"
	description
		"<p>
			primitives*: For want of a more appropriate term, in this section the term primitive will have the meaning: a value that can be directly stored in a Record or Tuple.
			i.e. records, tuples, boxes, null, undefined, booleans, numbers, strings, symbols, and bigints.
		</p>
		<p>
			The original rationale for introducing Box is to allow Records and Tuples to explicitly reference a value that would otherwise be disallowed
			to be 'stored' directly within Records and Tuples e.g. functions.
			Values like numbers can already be stored in a Record or Tuple.
			While allowing primitives* to be stored in a Box may be ergonomic for the producer of the Box,
			complexity has been moved to the consumers of Boxes. Consumers can no longer rely on the guarantee that a Box will always
			reference a 'non-primitive*'.
		</p>
		<p>
			It appears that there might be situations where checking if a Record contains an Object or not will be important, because of the difference in semantics.
			e.g. checking for cycles, passing values across a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm\\\">ShadowRealm</a> boundary,
			or <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple/issues/233#issuecomment-895044432\\\">storing values in a WeakMap</a>.
			If primitives* can be stored in a Box, then code checking if a Record/Tuple transitively contains an Object can no
			longer be performed with a single call to a <pre>Box.containsBoxes</pre> predicate, instead different/additional helpers would be needed for this use-case.
			e.g. <pre>Object.containsObject</pre> or <pre>Box.containsBoxWithIdentity</pre>. These helpers <i>may</i> be harder to explain than 'containsBoxes'.
			Note: These helpers can be implemented in user-land, recursively walking the tree inspecting the values. They do not necessarily need to be built-in.

issue noPrimitivesInBox {
	summary
		"Box construction ergonomics"
	description
		"If the Box constructor throws for values that can be 'stored' directly in a Record and
		Tuple, such as strings, numbers, booleans. This adds complexity for code that is trying to
		use Boxes generically, they will now need to check if a value can be put in a Box before
		attempting to construct the Box, or be sure to handle the possibility that an exception will
		be thrown. From a different perspective there could be an advantage to an exception being
		thrown - it <i>may</i> help clarify the purpose of Boxes and make unnecessary boxing

issue recordProxies {
	summary
		"Record proxies"
	description
		"It appears that a Record-Proxy would not be able to be much different from 'new
		Proxy(Object.freeze({...record}), handler)'. This is because if the Proxy still retained
		Record semantics, then equality checks would need to trigger the traps. Causing arbitrary JS
		to run during previously safe operations like '==='. This means that the returning proxy can
		not be transparent, and will instead be an object and not a record. It could be better to
		throw instead so this API space remains open for new ideas on how to achieve this in the
		future."

issue proxyThrowTypeofObject {
	summary
		"proxy ergonomics"
	description
		"Usually if something has typeof 'object' then it would be safe to create a proxy of it. But
		if records and tuples are typeof 'object' and throw when passed to the proxy constructor,
		this causes users to update their code to manually convert Records/Tuples into their frozen
		object counterparts before passing them to the proxy constructor."

			b' and 'Object.is(a, b)' will always return the same result.
		</p>
		<p>
			The current laboratory setup would mean that this is no longer an invariant of the
			language. Because given two almost identical tuples, except one has positive zero, and
			the other has negative zero. These would both have typeof 'object' and be '===' equal to
			each other, but not equal when compared by Object.is.

		"Tuple prototype equality"
	description
		"<p>
			Records do not have a '[[prototype]]', it is null. Tuples on the other hand do have a '[[prototype]]', being lists they
